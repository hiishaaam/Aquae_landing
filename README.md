# AquaeImpact Landing Page

Hi! I'm an intern who is learning to code, and this is the landing page project I worked on called **AquaeImpact**. This project is built using **React** and **Vite**. It's my first experience working with modern web development tools, and I learned a lot while building it!

## About the Project
AquaeImpact is a landing page designed to showcase information about water impact and environmental awareness. The page includes sections like a hero banner, information cards, a navbar, a footer, and some cool images and graphics. I used React components to organize the different parts of the page, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to use components in React to build reusable UI pieces
- How to style a website using Tailwind CSS
- How to manage project files and assets
- How to use git for version control

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser to the local server address (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

## Folder Structure
- `src/components/` - Contains all the React components for the landing page
- `public/` - Images and static assets
- `App.jsx` - Main app file
- `index.html` - The HTML template

## Acknowledgements
- Thanks to my mentors and teammates for helping me learn!
- This project uses open source tools like React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

I'm excited to keep learning and improving my coding skills! :)
